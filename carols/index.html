  Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer<br>
  had a very shiny nose.<br>
  And if you ever saw him,<br>

  All of the other reindeer<br>

  won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"<br>

  Then all the reindeer loved him<br>
  as they shouted out with glee:<br>
  "Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer,<br>

  Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh<br>
  Over the fields we go, laughing all the way;<br>
  Bells on bob-tail ring, making spirits bright<br>
  What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight<br>
  <br>
  Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!<br>
  O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh<br>
  Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!<br>
  O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh<br>
  <br>
  A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride<br>
  And soon Miss Fanny Bright, was seated by my side;<br>
  The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot;<br>
  He got into a drifted bank and we got upsot<br>
  <br>
  Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!<br>
  O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh<br>
  Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!<br>
  O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh<br>
  <br>
  A day or two ago, the story I must tell<br>
  I went out on the snow, and on my back I fell;<br>
  A gent was riding by, in a one-horse open sleigh<br>
  He laughed as there I sprawling lie but quickly drove away<br>
  <br>
  Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!<br>
  O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh<br>
  Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!<br>
  O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh<br>
  <br>
  Now the ground is white, go it while you're young<br>
  Take the girls tonight, and sing this sleighing song;<br>
  Just get a bob-tailed bay, two-forty as his speed<br>
  Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack! you'll take the lead<br>
  <br>
  Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!<br>
  O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh<br>
  Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!<br>
  O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh<br>
